          <p>
          This square was renamed “Skanderbeg” Square on November 26, 1937. It was projected in a circular shape and with a circular fountain in the middle, while the building that dominated was the old Municipality which was demolished in 1980. This square was surrounded by: Old Bazaar, Clock Tower, Et’hem Bey Mosque, Evangelical Church. During the years of socialism in this square was placed the statue of Stalin (November 4, 1951) which lasted until 1968 when it was replaced with the monument of Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg. The monument was built there on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the death of our national hero. Now, Skanderbeg Square is a space dedicated only to pedestrians. Paved with a carpet of stones from all Albanian lands and from all the provinces of Albania, on which on sunny days flows the rainwater collected inside it.

          <p>
             The Clock Tower of Tirana began to be built by Haxhi Et’hem Bey in 1822 and ended with the contribution of wealthy families of Tirana. Since the tower has accompanied the development of the city this was reflected in its appearance where the first half is of the Ottoman style, the whole part is carved with stones, while from the balcony above it is of the western style. The Clock Tower is a symbol of the emblem of the Municipality of Tirana and together with the Et’hem Bey Mosque forms a unique architectural ensemble.

          <p>
         This castle is located in the historic center of the city of Tirana, in one of its most frequented areas. It represents a field fortification with a rectangular plan 525 ft by 394 ft (160 x 120m) with the longest part east-west. During the excavations carried out in 2001 and 2008, it is thought that the castle belongs to one of the fortifications built or rebuilt by Emperor Justinian in New Epirus ( province of Durres) in the 4-6th century of our era. Within the walls of the castle of Tirana, a new pedestrian area has recently been created, transformed into a recreational space for the capital. This space serves as an environment where artisans and local traditions, cuisine, and art of Tirana are promoted.

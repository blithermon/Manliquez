                   Ferges is, without a doubt, one of the most traditional foods in Albania. The dish consists mainly of tomato sauce, cottage cheese, green peppers, and garliThe main reason why this dish is called a summer stew is that many Albanians like to eat it after it has gone cold. The best way to eat this dish is to wait for it to cool down for about 2-3 hours. This gives it a thicker consistency and makes the ingredients stand out more.Ferges is usually eaten only with bread. I usually dip toasted bread in the dish and eat it.The dish is not really a typical menu option in Albanian restaurants, but you can try it in countryside restaurants that serve traditional food.

                  This appetizer is a great dish that Albanians usually eat before a meat-based entrée.It is usually served during the summer due to it being rather cold when served. The dish is made with Greek yogurt, cold water, shredded cucumber, and salt. The appetizer has the consistency of a soup, so it is normal for this dish to be served in a bowl.It tastes very similar to the traditional Albanian drink dhalle. This is the reason why many foreigners find it surprising when they see tarator served in a bowl.This appetizer is beloved mostly by the older generation as youngsters prefer dhalle because it is more practical to consume.

                   It is made out of three different kinds of milk that include evaporated milk, heavy cream, and condensed milk. In Turkey and Albania, unlike in Central and South America, the cake is then topped with caramel that gives it a strong sweet taste. Depending on the region, this Albanian cake can be light and consisting of air bubbles or concentrated and thick.The consistency of the cake itself all depends on how much butter is used in the recipe.Trilece has a very unique taste that can be described as lightly crispy and sweet at the top, soft and light in the middle, and juicy on the bottom. However, this dessert is not for everyone. Most people that haven’t gotten used to the taste might find the soft and moist texture of the Trilece too overpowering to eat.If you love a soft, moist, and sweet dessert then you can find this cake in any Albanian pastry shop.

Eggs (separated)
Vanilla
Milk
Evaporated Milk
